This example demonstrates a common error in VBScript related to the absence of function overloading.  VBScript does not support defining multiple functions with the same name; the last definition will always override the previous ones. This can be a source of confusion for programmers accustomed to languages that support overloading. The solution shows how to work around this limitation by using conditional logic within a single function or creating functions with distinct names.
